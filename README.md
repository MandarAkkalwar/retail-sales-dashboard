# Retail Sales Dashboard

This Power BI project demonstrates a retail sales analytics dashboard built on a sample dataset. It highlights key sales metrics and trends for a fictional retail business, providing an interactive overview of performance. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders quickly understand revenue drivers and customer distribution.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Retail Sales Dashboard is to provide insights into overall sales performance, trends over time, and customer distribution across product categories. It enables managers to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as **Total Revenue** and **Customer Count**, identify sales trends by month, and analyze product-category and demographic (age group) breakdowns. By aggregating and visualizing these metrics, the dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for sales strategy and inventory planning.

## Dataset

The dashboard uses a sample retail sales dataset. The data includes sales transactions across multiple stores, with fields like *Month*, *Product Category*, *Age Group*, *Customer ID*, and sales-related measures. Since it is sample-based, no external data connection is required.

## Key Features
